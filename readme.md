## Example Queries

There are two main query types: Lookup and Search.

Lookup will return a given entity from it's discogs id. The following example will return the name of the label, and its first 5 releases. The [Relay connection specification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm 'Relay connection specification') is also supported.

```graphql
query {
  lookup {
    label(id: 271) {
      name
      releases(first: 5) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
          }
        }
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
          endCursor
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The search query will search an entity on combinations of fields that are specific to each. For example the following query searches for Deep House from 1992 released on US labels.

```graphql
query {
  search {
    release(styles: "Deep House", released: "1992", country: "US", first: 50) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          styles
          released
          country
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
